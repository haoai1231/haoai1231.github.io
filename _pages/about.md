I am  Hao Ai (艾浩). Since Fall 2024, I have been pursuing a Master’s degree in Mathematics at Fuzhou University. My research centers on Electronic Design Automation (EDA), with a specific focus on physical design and multiphysics computation. Prior to this, I conducted research on the dynamics of stochastic delay systems and stochastic control.

## 📢 News  ( Looking forward to good news! 🌟)

* **[Oct. 2025]** 📝 We have released a new preprint that establishes the mathematical foundations of the PeF floorplanner. We provide a variational analysis to explain why it is consistently effective and robust. Check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08126).
* **[Oct. 2025]** 🎉 One paper has been accepted by TCAD. Congratulations and thanks to my collaborators.
