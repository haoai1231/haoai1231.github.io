I am AiHao. Since Fall 2024, I have been pursuing a Master’s degree in Mathematics at Fuzhou University. My research centers on Electronic Design Automation (EDA), with a specific focus on physical design and multiphysics computation. Prior to this, I conducted research on the dynamics of stochastic delay systems and stochastic control.
